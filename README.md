## Introduction

This projects is a charity website where mostly second hands items are sold in order to raise money and donate to various charity organizations.

It's main features are a product list where users can view items and add them to their basket in order to buy. Also, charity events are advertised in order to inform the website's users and visitors.

The project was built keeping the Agile management principles in mind, and I utilized many of GitHub's features such as Issue and Projects to complete the website. A [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/parides55/projects/3) was used as well to implement the users stories and to keep track of the features left to do.

I used GitHub issues for the product backlog containing the user stories and the labels feature in GitHub Issues for prioritizing features based on the MoSCoW method, and categorizing the user stories.

CRUD functionality

- Users can read all approved reviews, create, update and delete their own reviews.
- Users can create, read, update and delete their basket and their favorites list.
- Admins can create, read, update and delete all the content of the page (products, events, basket items, favorite items, reviews, messages, 'our story' content)

<summary>Issues on GitHub with labels</summary>

## User stories

User stories were prepared using GitHub Issues and assigned acceptance criteria for each story, which were used for the manual testing.

User Stories can been seen below under [User Story Testing](#user-story-testing), and in the GitHub Issues for full details including screenshots and acceptance criteria.

## UX

As this is a charity shop, and it's purpose is to give hope to families and their kids, I decided to use the green color, as it is regarded as the color of hope. And by choosing a lighter version of the green color is less tiring to the eye and less distractive to the user's eye. Also, the logo of the organization illustrates a happy family. Using [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23CCE0C5&sub=1) and [Design.com](https://www.design.com/) the following colors were used.

![Colors](Readme_docs/color_palette_optimized.png)

### Typography

- [Roboto google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=roboto) were used for the headings.
- [Montserrat google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montse) were user for all other text.

## Accessibility

To ensure maximum accessibility for all users I used `aria-labels` on all Buttons and Anchor tags. Furthermore, after some research, I found that using SVGs instead font icons, maximizes the accessibility to the website. Especially, if the user is using their custom fonts via their browser. This is very nicely presented and explained in Seren Davies' presentation [Death to Icon Fonts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xXBYcWgCHA)

I, also, ensured that every element still met AAA level in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AAA-Conformance) (WCAG).

## Database Design

![Database Design](https://github.com/parides55/charity_shop/blob/main/Readme_docs/Charity_Shop_Database.drawio.png)

## Features

This website utilizes numerous features from an e-commerce website and a blog. Also, it offers the possibility to the users to sign up by registering a username, an email and a password, in order to allow them to buy products and leave comments/reviews on the events shown.

### Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is shown in all pages and it provides an easy way to navigate throughout the whole website. On the left side the logo of the organization is shown and it is also a link to the home page. A link to the home page is the organization's name on the top which is displayed continuously in all displays. On the right side the user icons are found which they are only shown if the user is authenticated, otherwise just a login icon is shown. Also, if the user is a superuser an additional selection appears to allow the superuser to access the Admin Panel. Through the user icons, the users can navigate to their favorite page, where their favorite products are stored, to the their basket so they can proceed to check out or to remove the selected products and also to log out.

</details>

### Footer

The footer is shown on all pages and it's purpose is to provide a quick and easy access to the this repository and to the privacy policy of the organization. Also, other social media icons can be used in the future, but at this time the webpage does not have any other media.

</details>

### Basket

This page displays all the items that the user intents to buy. The items are presented in a table format where the Product's title, the quantity, the price per item and the total price for the item is shown. At the bottom of the table the total amount of the order is shown. Also, next to each item there's a '-' button to allow the user to remove any item. When clicked, a confirmation message is displayed on the top of the page indicating successful or not removal. At the bottom of the table the 'Continue Shopping' button will redirect the user to the products page and the 'Proceed to Checkout' button will take the user to the payment link provided by Stripe. After successful payment, the user is directed to the 'Thank for your payment' page and 2 buttons are displayed. One to search for more products and one to view the events. Lastly, after successful payment the user's items are deleted from their basket.

Because this website is not registered yet with any authorities as an approved charity organization, to handle payments, I'm use a sandbox account from Paypal, which takes the total amount and depending on the user's choice it simulates a transaction. To use the Paypal Button, the user has to be registered with paypal. TO use the "Debit or Credit Card" option the following cards,from the [Paypal's Card Testing](https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/sandbox/card-testing/) webpage have been used and tested successfully:

## Testing

### Browser Compatibility

I tested the website on 3 different operating systems on four different types of hardware and didn't find any rendering bugs between the browsers tested.

| Operating System       | Chrome | Firefox | Edge | Safari |
|------------------------|--------|---------|------|--------|
| Windows 11             | ✅     | ✅      | ✅   | ❌   |
| Android 14             | ✅     | ✅      | ✅   | ❌   |
| iOS & iPadOS 17        | ✅     | ✅      | ✅   | ✅   |

❌ = couldn't test Safari on the above devises.

### Responsiveness

I tested for responsiveness on many different sized view ports and using different hardware (Monitors, Laptops, Phones).

    - `SECRET_KEY`: *your secret key*
- Select the 'Deploy' tab at the top.
- Select 'GitHub' and confirm you wish to deploy using GitHub. You may be asked to enter your GitHub password.
- Find the 'Connect to GitHub' section and use the search box to locate your repo.
- Select 'Connect' when found.
- Optionally choose the main branch under 'Automatic Deploys' and select 'Enable Automatic Deploys' if you wish your deployed site to be automatically redeployed every time you push changes to GitHub.
- Find the 'Manual Deploy' section, choose 'main' as the branch to deploy and select 'Deploy Branch'.
- Your site will shortly be deployed and you will be given a link to the deployed site when the process is complete.

## Credits

The biggest credits need to go to my wife Maria, who actually took all of the photos of the products and create the description of all of them and actively supported me throughout this project. Also, she wrote the content of the OUR STORY page.

### Content

- [Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-p3](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-p3) template was used to create this repo.
- Events were taken from Google search
- A lot of reference was taken from the [Developing with Django](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+FSD101_WTS+2/courseware/31f4d0db719b4ae38601295fa2151b5c/376093d8bf5a4b2abd2e47bdf47b82bf/) code of [Code of Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/global/) project to performed CRUD functionality and establish the models.

### Media

- [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) were used extensively in the project

### Acknowledgements

- Thanks to my mentor for his guidance regarding the structure of the models and the successful perfomrance of the basket page.
